## Motivation

The goal of nflseedR is to … Introduce package and maybe NFL
tiebreakers? Explain what the package can do (i.e. div rank, seeds and
draft order for multiple seasons) and what the limitations are
(e.g. tiebreakers through sos and than coinflip instead of the remaining
tiebreaking levels) Explain that all algorithms are developed by Lee and
the package is built mostly by Seb
